# A hack to make the resolver pull in the correct sp1 branch when processing the reth and revm deps.
# This is intended to be a temporary hotfix while the dependency issue in the upstream packages is
# being fixed.
#
# Note the doubled up '/' character. It is present to make Cargo treat the target git repository as
# being distinct from the source. That is to work around the current limitation in Cargo where
# patches differing solely in git branch/tag are not allowed. This may stop working in the future.
