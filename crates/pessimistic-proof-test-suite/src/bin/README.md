# Pessimistic Proof Generator

This utility generates pessimistic proofs on sample data.

```
cargo run -r -p pessimistic-proof-test-suite --bin ppgen -- --help
```

## Local mode

The following command will generate one plonk proof with the default mode which is local.

```
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -r -p pessimistic-proof-test-suite --bin ppgen -- --proof-dir ./data/proofs/ --n-exits 10
```

The local mode requires a large machine with ~128GB RAM.

### Bridge exits and Imported bridge exits

The transition is given by:

- The number of bridge exits: `--n-exits <number>`
- The number of imported bridge exits: `--n-imported-exits <number>`

It will generate one Certificate with `--n-exits` brige exits and `--n-imported-exits` imported bridge exits.

The events are cyclically taken from the optional sample file given by `--sample-path`.
If not provided, this default sample file of 200 events is used: [withdrawals.json](../../data/withdrawals.json)

## Network mode

The succinct infrastructure generates the proof upon request. This requires to define two environment variables:

```
SP1_PROVER=network
SP1_PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

Then, the command remains the same:

```
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -r -p pessimistic-proof-test-suite --bin ppgen -- --proof-dir ./data/proofs/ --n-exits 10
```

Expected logs:

```

```

The first line in the logs is the full Certificate which is trimmed in this example.

The execution outputs a json file which contains the following:

- The certificate
- The signer address
- The public inputs of the pessimistic proof in clear and serialized for the verifier
- The SNARK pessimistic proof
- The verifier key

## Proof output

Use `--proof-dir` to save the proof as a JSON file in the specified directory. If not set, the proof will be logged instead.
